### Review

![Cover](http://cdn1.ticbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/portal2.png)

Pros:
The game graphics offer a subtle blend of interesting story with Imaginative sci-fi art style.

Great CVs performance impressive soundtrack and the ED is interesting. 

Great skill in narrative (A story about betrayal and freedom)

A perfect co-operative mode which significantly alters the way you need to think.

The challenges are awesome especially in large free scene.

Cons:
Some Game items not being rational use and the puzzles should be a little harder.
